# BlackHatTools

## A collection of tools written in Go

Due to the recent popularity of Go being used as a malware development language, I have taken it upon myself to learn it as well.
Go is a highly performant, concurrent, and memory safe language.

The collection of tools shall be followed by a textbook called Black Hat Go.
